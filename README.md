# OBST_parallel_algorithm

In computer science, an optimal binary search tree, sometimes called a weight-balanced binary tree,
is a binary search tree which provides the smallest possible search time for a given sequence of accesses. (source : wikipedia)

Running on cmd : 

1) javac OBST_parallel_algorithm.java
2) java OBST_parallel_algorithm

3) Prompted to enter number of nodes in the tree : (say 1500)

4) Prompted to enter number of threads for parallel processing : (say 8)

5) Output -

==== Calculating Time for Searial OBST Algorithm ====

The optimal cost for BST is = 643276.3722560313

Time Taken by Serial OBST Algorithm = 6714 milliseconds

==== Calculating Time for Parallel OBST Algorithm ====

The optimal cost for BST is = 643276.3722560313

Time Taken by Parallel OBST Algorithm = 3346 milliseconds
